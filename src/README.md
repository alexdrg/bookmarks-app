Note: This project is not fully complete due to a scheduling oversight on my part before I received this challenge. While I made significant progress on the implementation, I couldnâ€™t finalize all planned features within the time available.

I would be delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the remaining implementation steps and my approach to completing the project. This could provide further insights into my problem-solving process and technical skills.
